## 💡 Q&A Preparation

**Q: How does it know which claims are true?**
A: We cross-check against trusted sources like WHO, CDC, Reuters. The AI summarizes findings and shows its reasoning.

**Q: What if sources disagree?**
A: We calculate a confidence score based on source consensus. Mixed claims are marked as "PARTIALLY_TRUE".

**Q: Can this scale to millions of claims?**
A: Yes! This architecture scales horizontally. We'd use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite, cache with Redis, and run agents in parallel.

**Q: How is user privacy protected?**
A: We don't collect personal data. Fact-checks are public information. All data is stored locally unless deployed to cloud.

**Q: What about non-English claims?**
A: Multilingual support for Spanish, French, Hindi built-in. Summaries available in multiple languages.

**Q: Can it be integrated into social media platforms?**
A: Yes! API endpoints allow platforms to check claims. We could add webhooks for automatic labeling.
